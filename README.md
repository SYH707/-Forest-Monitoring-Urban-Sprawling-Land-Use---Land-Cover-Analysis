# Forest Monitoring, Urban Sprawling, Land Use - Land Cover Analysis

This project involves analyzing forest monitoring, urban sprawl, and land use/land cover changes. The goal was to assess how urban development impacts land cover and forest areas.

## Tools & Techniques
- *QGIS*: Used to develop maps for analyzing land use and land cover changes, including urban sprawl and forest monitoring.
- *MS Excel*: Applied for data analysis and visualization to support the mapping and interpretation of land use trends.

## Key Contributions
- Developed detailed maps to visualize and analyze changes in land use and forest cover.
- Conducted analysis to assess the impact of urban sprawl on forest areas and land cover.
